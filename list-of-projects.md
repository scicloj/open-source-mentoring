The ðŸ›  symbol means that somebody has started looking into a project an will probably continue with that.

* ðŸ›  create a bridge to the [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) library for statistical computing - in other words, add Clojure to the [BridgeStan](https://roualdes.github.io/bridgestan/latest/) project of polyglot Stan bindings

* ðŸ›  create a [Scittle](https://github.com/babashka/scittle) plugin for [Emmy-viewers](https://github.com/mentat-collective/emmy-viewers)

* ðŸ›  extend the [Conjure](https://conjure.oli.me.uk/) [bindings](https://github.com/Olical/conjure/wiki/Integrating-with-Clay-and-data-visualisation-tools) for [Clay](https://scicloj.github.io/clay) notebooking - add Quarto support, etc.

* ðŸ›  add a function for printing linear regression models in [Fastmath](https://github.com/generateme/fastmath)

* ðŸ›  create a Clojure backend to Plotly's [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) (a polyglot (Python/R/Julia/F#) dashboarding system)

* ðŸ›  build a [Kindly](https://scicloj.github.io/kindly-noted/) adapter for [Clojupyter](https://github.com/clojupyter/clojupyter)

* help document [the upcoming version 3 of Fastmath](https://github.com/generateme/fastmath/tree/3.x)

* port Java/XML exmaples of [Tribuo](https://tribuo.org/) to Clojure/EDN ones for [scicloj.ml.tribuo](https://github.com/scicloj/scicloj.ml.tribuo)

* contribute docstrings and unit tests to [dtype-next](https://github.com/cnuernber/dtype-next)

* test Clojure libraries on existing benchmarks

* add support for data formats (e.g. Zarr, Avro) conversion for [tech.ml.dataset](https://github.com/techascent/tech.ml.dataset)


* improve the Clojure integration in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)

* [translate a book chapter](https://github.com/scicloj/translating-books) to Clojure

* look into early-stage libraries such as [cmdstan-clj](https://github.com/scicloj/cmdstan-clj), try them out, discover problems, and improve

* make various contributions to the [Jank](https://jank-lang.org/) programming language

* create a bridge to a relevant C or C++ library using [clong](https://github.com/phronmophobic/clong)

* [Tablecloth](https://scicloj.github.io/tablecloth/)-related tasks - see [Zulip discussion](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/451344-scicloj-open-source-mentoring/topic/Tablecloth) for relevant tasks

* join the [Clay](https://scicloj.github.io/clay/) team and take on Clay-related tasks
