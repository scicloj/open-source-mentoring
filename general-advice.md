# General Advice

(last updated: 2024-08-15)

Given all the time demands and uncertainty in our lives, maintaining open-source work and reaching the actual fruits of it can be challenging. 
Here are some recommended practices based on our experience.

* Sync with your mentor often. Make sure that, together, you find clarity regarding all the details below.

* Know where to ask questions. For most Scicloj-related topics, this will often be a stream at the [Clojurians Zulip chat](https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/chat/). For certain topics, it will be a channel at the [Clojurians Slack](http://clojurians.net).

* Remember it is just fine to be confused. Being comfortable with that is important.

* But do not remain stuck. If it seems there is no way forward, get help over the chat streams.

* Know what your main next steps are, and discuss their priorities. It is fine to spend some time in curious explorations, but it is recommended that a decent portion of your time will be spent on directions that are justified by your goals.

* Know when your next meeting is. For most projects, it will be a good practice to have a weekly meeting with your mentor or other collaborators. 

* Share your work-in-progress steps in the chat and seek feedback. Doing so, you will encourage others.

* Find reasonably small steps that can be shared publicly. Use the broader community's feedback.

* Join the Scicloj [dev groups and study groups](https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/). Use them to find inspiration in other people's stories.
